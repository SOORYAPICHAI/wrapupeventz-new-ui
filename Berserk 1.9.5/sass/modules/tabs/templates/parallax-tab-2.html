        <p class="brk-dark-font-color text-left mb-20">On a Thursday afternoon in late spring, 32-year-old Glossier
          founder and CEO Emily Weiss rides the elevator to the penthouse level of her company's downtown Manhattan
          headquarters. She's a thoroughly millennial girlboss in jeans, sneakers and a royal blue sweatshirt with
          weiss embroidered in small white script. Her hair is pulled back in a ponytail, and for the founder of a
          beauty products company, she wears notably little makeup - just some mascara and possibly a swipe of
          Glossier Lip Gloss, a recent product release touted online as having a "fuzzy doe-foot applicator."</p>
        <p class="brk-dark-font-color text-left  mb-60">A former teen model, Weiss is beautiful but not
          intimidating, either by nature or by design (probably a little of both). After all, her companyâ€™s
          popularity is directly related to her ability to cultivate a feeling of friendship with and among her
          customers. Just enough relatability is key.</p>
